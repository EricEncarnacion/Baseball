			<p>Baseball grew out of a game called “town ball” (sometimes just called base) 
			which was a very informal game that had grown out of the British game rounders.
			The rules of Baseball were originally formalized by the New York Knickerbockers 
			Baseball Club starting in 1845 who played in the first recorded baseball game 
			in 1846.</p>
