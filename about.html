			<h1>Project</h1>
			<p>Eric Encarnacion / CIS155 / V1 project / 7/20/2019</p>
			<p>Mainly added header elements. Header image and navigation bar. 
			Short paragraph about baseball, but still needing get the spacing 
			and margins right. Added a link to the about page. As well a link to 
			go back to the homepage. DId not anticiapating writing from scratch would 
			take as long as it did, hopefully will learn in time to write them more efficiently.</p>
			<p> Eric Encarnacion / CIS155 / V2 project / 8/10/2019</p>
			<p> Added back ground image. Also figure boxes showing tranformations and shadowing affects.
			Created table showing different positions in baseball. Overall made the website more pleasing visually.</p>
			<p> V3 Project /  8/22/2019</p>
			<p> Added new rules page with a form requesting information. Also added GitHub url. https://github.com/EricEncarnacion/Baseball </p>
